# Darkness Check

A little CLI, built in Rust that lets you find out how many hours of darkness you're in for today. 

## Usage 

Type `darkness_check <CITY> <COUNTRY>` into your terminal. ðŸ’¨! That's it.

## Installation 

Go to the releases page, which I will link when it's real.

**Built as an @axodotdev onboarding project.**
